# ML Clustering: Weather Stations

* Used a **DBSCAN** algorithm that that clusters Weather Stations by location and precipitation.
* Optimized the **DBSCAN** algorithm by using selecting for the most appropriate **Epsilon** and a **Minimum Number of Samples** to obtain the best clustering.
* Plotted a **Folium Map** of the **Clustered Results**.
